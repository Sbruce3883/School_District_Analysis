# School_District_Analysis
Helping Maria analyze data on student funding and standardized test scores - specifically, math and reading - for PyCity School District.

## Overview
PyCity School District asked for a snapshot of several key metrics by each school and district level.  The analysis focused on the performance of math and reading scores in preparation for an upcoming board meeting  However, after the school board reviewed the data, it was determined that the data from Thomas High School's 9th grade class showed evidence of academic dishonesty  The school board asked for the data to be removed and analyzed again for comparison while keeping the remainder of the data intact.
